            <h2>Cape Town, home of Table Mountain</h2>
            <p>
              Nestled between the iconic Table Mountain and the glistening
              Atlantic Ocean, Cape Town is a breathtaking destination that
              seamlessly blends natural beauty, rich history, and vibrant
              culture. Known as the "Mother City" of South Africa, it boasts
              stunning landscapes, from the rugged cliffs of Cape Point to the
              golden beaches of Camps Bay.
            </p>
            <p class="smaller-device-hide">
              Visitors can explore the historic streets of the Bo-Kaap,
              experience the lively atmosphere of the V&A Waterfront, or take a
              ferry to Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was once imprisoned.
              Whether you're an adventure seeker, a foodie, or a history
              enthusiast, Cape Town offers something for everyone. With its warm
              hospitality, world-class wine regions, and unforgettable sunsets,
              this city is a must-visit gem on any traveler's list.

            <p>
              Hey! My name is Sinesipho Sono and I was born and raised in Cape
              Town. I absolutely love Cape Town. It is a beautiful city with so
              many sights and sceneries that it is naturally an attraction for
              tourists. I created this page as part of my SheCodes Responsive
              project putting together my love for the city and my love for
              coding all in one page!
