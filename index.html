            <p>
              Hey! My name is Sinesipho Sono and I was born and raised in Cape
              Town. I absolutely love Cape Town. It is a beautiful city with so
              many sights and sceneries that it is naturally an attraction for
              tourists. I created this page as part of my SheCodes Responsive
              project putting together my love for the city and my love for
              coding all in one page!

            <p>
              This website was created as part of a project for the SheCodes
              Responsive workshop. It was designed to portray the skills I have
              learnt and to form part of my portfolio. This project was coded by
              <a href="https://github.com/Sinesipho-Sono" target="_blank"
                >Sinesipho Sono
              </a>
              and it is
              <a href="https://github.com/Sinesipho-Sono/Travel-landing-page">
                open-sourced </a
